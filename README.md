## bitwise_batch_normalization
 Implementation of test code for bitwise batch normalization for binary neural networks
 
 Purpose: 
 - find out if my proposed version is indeed an acceptable approximation
 - investigate how much of the information would be lost
 - test the gradient computation for the backpropagation
 - vanilla reference implementation for hardware friendly implementation for FPGA
